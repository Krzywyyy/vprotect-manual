# Recovery Plans

Recovery plans are used to automate DR process, so that vProtect executes multiple restore operations to the target environment with preconfigured settings.

Recovery plans can be executed on-demand or on a scheduled basis \(for instance to test the recovery process periodically\). Recovery plans consist of rules, each one for a particular virtualization platform, which specify VMs, restore settings and optionally schedules. Only rules marked as active are executed.

Restore operations will be performed according to the restore/import task limits set in Node Configuration. In the target environment new VMs will be created. Names are generated by default \(with optional prefix/suffix\), optionally original name can be used. For periodic restores, it is common to replace the previous VM, which typically means that options to use the original VM name and deletion of the virtual environment with the same name are checked.
