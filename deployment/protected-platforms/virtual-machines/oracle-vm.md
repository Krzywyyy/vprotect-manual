# Oracle VM

## Deployment in Oracle VM environment

Oracle VM environment requires you to create storage used for VM export. Export storage repository should accessible also by vProtect Node in its staging directory. This implies that storage space doesn't have to be exported by vProtect Node - it can be mounted from an external source. The only requirement is to have it visible from both OVM hosts and Node itself. Keep in mind that ownership of the files on the share should allow both vProtect and OVM to read and write files.

Oracle VM environments require storage repositories to be defined for each server pool and must be mounted on the vProtect node.

1. Create repository from NFS share on vProtect node
   * One server pool should have a separate subdirectory in the export path i.e. `/vprotect_data/pool01`, `/vprotect_data/pool2` - each subdirectory is a separate NFS share
   * Export \(staging\) path in the above-mentioned scenario is still `/vprotect_data`, while `pool01` and `pool02` are server pool names
   * Specify mapping between server pool names and storage repository names in node configuration \(section `Hypervisor`\)
   * Note that export must be set to use UID and GID of `vprotect` user
   * Example export configuration in `/etc/exports` to the selected hypervisor in the RHV cluster:

     ```text
     /vprotect_data/pool01    10.50.1.101(fsid=6,rw,sync,insecure,
     all_squash,anonuid=993,anongid=990)
     /vprotect_data/pool02    10.50.1.102(fsid=7,rw,sync,insecure,
     all_squash,anonuid=993,anongid=990)
     ```

     where `anonuid=993` and `anongid=990` should have correct UID and GID returned by command:

     ```text
     [root@vProtect3 ~]# id vprotect
     uid=993(vprotect) gid=990(vprotect) groups=990(vprotect)
     ```
2. Both import and export operations will be done using these NFS shares â€“ restore will be done directly to this storage domain, so you can easily import the backup into the Oracle VM environment.
   * Backups must be restored to the export path \(node automatically changes names to the original paths that are recognized by the OVM manager.
